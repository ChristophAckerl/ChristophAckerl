ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ChristophAckerl

I'm spending most of my time developing either websites or full-stack web-applications for either my freelancing clients or the company I work for.

My FEs are mainly written in either ReactJS or NextJS, while my BEs are either NodeJS or .Net microservices written in C#, which also mostly depends on what DB I'm using for the given project. 

I predominantly use MSSQL, ArangoDB or MongoDB for my projects while also occasionally using Redis as a caching DB if need be.
